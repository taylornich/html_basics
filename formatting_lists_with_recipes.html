            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
            <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
